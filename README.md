Maori Diceware Password Generation

Intention is for an offline javascript html page to generate high entropy diceware passwords using Maori words.

Premise: 10 ( or more ) Maori words randomly generated from 12,585 word list is log2( 12585^10 / 2 ) = 135.19 bits.

Looking currently at the entropy collection and other concepts from https://github.com/cantonbecker/bitcoinpaperwallet
